## Idea

We want to show the most frequency words in several master pieces of Literature.

---

## Performance
      
      
               
The app is running in https://pvmllaneza.shinyapps.io/Developing_Data_Products_Project/

## Options

We can choose between three master pieces books.      
And we can modify the frequency and minimum number of words.
